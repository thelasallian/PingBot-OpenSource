# NOTICE
The bot currently relies on pythonanywhere.com using a free account, 
so it may slow down once maximum CPU usage has been reached. 
This resets every 22 hours. The bot also relies on Google Sheets 
to add/edit the tags, but an update so that they may be edited using 
only Telegram will be available to the official bot.

# How to deploy the bot:
1. Use a python hosting service (pythonanywhere.com)
2. Install the following using the bash console:
    "pip install python-telegram-bot"
    "pip install pandas"
3. Save and Run the code
